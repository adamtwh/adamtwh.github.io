Hi! Welcome to IS216-G9 Group 7's Project -- Homemate!

Here, we hosted our full working application on Github! (https://adamtwh.github.io/)

The link to our presentation slides can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V_973uqEoHKXwTW6BoT1qxNCwS_6w6UpiHwpefq7FzY/edit?usp=sharing

Before you head into the application, here is some advice from our Team!
1. Our application requires interaction between both the Contractor and Homeowner, and thus might lead to a rather tedious/long workflow since this involves multiple steps (already disregarding the lead time in a real scenario where both parties have to wait for each other's response)

2. It would be great to visualise the Firebase data when clicking and looking at any interactions. This would provide a clearer picture of the backend code and would make the experience much more fulfilling!

Otherwise, here are some login details that you can use:
<ins>For the user:</ins>
digijar (username)
hello (password)

<ins>For the contractor:</ins>
ahbeng (username)
ahbeng (password)

For the workflow, you can follow these few steps for a perfect walkthrough of a sample scenario, of course you are free to explore the website!

index.html (landing page) -> homepage.html (upon sign-in) -> ahbeng.html (if clicked on any contractor card in the carousel) OR conpage.html (if clicked on any of the services listed below) -> ahbeng.html (from conpage.html) -> booking.html (for a user to see his/her current, pending and completed bookings)
